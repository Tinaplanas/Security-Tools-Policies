<h1>‚öôÔ∏è Compliance Matrix: NIST vs ISO vs CMMC</h1>

This matrix is part of my journey to truly understand how cybersecurity frameworks align. Compliance isn‚Äôt just a checklist , it‚Äôs about understanding how to protect people, data, and operations at every level. I built this to help myself visualize where these frameworks overlap and how they speak to different organizational needs.

<h2>üí¨ Why I Did This</h2>
 I wanted to go beyond acronyms. I wanted to understand what protections truly matter and how real-world compliance frameworks compare. This project gave me that deeper clarity.
